h1. Pre-requisites

For the core itself:

* JDK 6: "http://java.sun.com/":http://java.sun.com/. Ensure @$JAVA_HOME@ is correctly set.
* Maven 2: "http://maven.apache.org/":http://maven.apache.org/.
* Protocol Buffers 2.3.0: "http://protobuf.googlecode.com/":http://protobuf.googlecode.com/.
* Zookeeper 3.4.0: "http://zookeeper.apache.org/":http://zookeeper.apache.org/.

Hedwig has been tested on Windows XP, Linux 2.6, and OS X.

h1. Command-Line Instructions

From the top level bookkeeper directory, run @mvn package@. This will compile and package the jars necessary for running hedwig. 

See the User's Guide for instructions on running and usage.

h1. Eclipse Instructions

To check out, build, and develop using Eclipse:

# Install the Subclipse plugin. Update site: "http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.4.x":http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.4.x.
# Install the Maven plugin. Update site: "http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/update":http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/update. From the list of packages available from this site, select everything under the &quot;Maven Integration&quot; category, and from the optional components select the ones with the word &quot;SCM&quot; in them.
# Go to Preferences &gt; Team &gt; SVN. For the SVN interface, choose &quot;Pure Java&quot;.
# Choose File &gt; New &gt; Project... &gt; Maven &gt; Checkout Maven Projects from SCM.
# For the SCM URL type, choose SVN. For the URL, enter SVN URL. Maven will automatically create a top-level Eclipse project for each of the 4 Maven modules (recommended). If you want fewer top-level projects, uncheck the option of having a project for each module (under Advanced).
# Right-click on the @protocol@ project and choose Run As &gt; Maven generate-sources. This will generate the Java and C++ code for Protocol Buffers.
# Refresh the workspace to pick up the generated code and add @hedwig/protocol/target/generated-sources/java@ as a source folder. (6 &amp; 7 should really be doable automatically, but I haven't figured out how.)

You are now ready to run and debug the client and server code. See the User's Guide for instructions on running and usage.
