h1. Abstract

This guide contains detailed information about using BookKeeper for logging. It discusses the basic operations BookKeeper supports, and how to create logs and perform basic read and write operations on these logs.

h1.  Instantiating BookKeeper.

p. The first step to use BookKeeper is to instantiate a BookKeeper object: 

 @org.apache.bookkeeper.BookKeeper @ 

p. There are three BookKeeper constructors: 

 @public BookKeeper(String servers) throws KeeperException, IOException @ 

p. where: 

*  @servers@ is a comma-separated list of ZooKeeper servers. 


 @public BookKeeper(ZooKeeper zk) throws InterruptedException, KeeperException @ 

p. where: 

*  @zk@ is a ZooKeeper object. This constructor is useful when the application also using ZooKeeper and wants to have a single instance of ZooKeeper. 


 @public BookKeeper(ZooKeeper zk, ClientSocketChannelFactory channelFactory) throws InterruptedException, KeeperException @ 

p. where: 

*  @zk@ is a ZooKeeper object. This constructor is useful when the application also using ZooKeeper and wants to have a single instance of ZooKeeper. 
*  @channelFactory@ is a netty channel object ( @org.jboss.netty.channel.socket@ ). 


h1.  Creating a ledger. 

p. Before writing entries to BookKeeper, it is necessary to create a ledger. With the current BookKeeper API, it is possible to create a ledger both synchronously or asynchronously. The following methods belong to @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookKeeper@ . 

 _Synchronous call:_ 

 @public LedgerHandle createLedger(int ensSize, int qSize, DigestType type,  byte passwd[]) throws KeeperException, InterruptedException, IOException, BKException @ 

p. where: 

*  @ensSize@ is the number of bookies (ensemble size); 
*  @qSize@ is the write quorum size; 
*  @type@ is the type of digest used with entries: either MAC or CRC32. 
*  @passwd@ is a password that authorizes the client to write to the ledger being created. 


p. All further operations on a ledger are invoked through the @LedgerHandle@ object returned. 

p. As a convenience, we provide a @createLedger@ with default parameters (3,2,VERIFIABLE), and the only two input parameters it requires are a digest type and a password. 

 _Asynchronous call:_ 

 @public void asyncCreateLedger(int ensSize, int qSize, DigestType type, byte passwd[], CreateCallback cb, Object ctx ) @ 

p. The parameters are the same of the synchronous version, with the exception of @cb@ and @ctx@ . @CreateCallback@ is an interface in @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback@ , and a class implementing it has to implement a method called @createComplete@ that has the following signature: 

 @void createComplete(int rc, LedgerHandle lh, Object ctx); @ 

p. where: 

*  @rc@ is a return code (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKException@ for a list); 
*  @lh@ is a @LedgerHandle@ object to manipulate a ledger; 
*  @ctx@ is a control object for accountability purposes. It can be essentially any object the application is happy with. 


p. The @ctx@ object passed as a parameter to the call to create a ledger is the one same returned in the callback. 

h1.  Adding entries to a ledger. 

p. Once we have a ledger handle @lh@ obtained through a call to create a ledger, we can start writing entries. As with creating ledgers, we can write both synchronously and asynchronously. The following methods belong to @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerHandle@ . 

 _Synchronous call:_ 

 @public long addEntry(byte[] data) throws InterruptedException @ 

p. where: 

*  @data@ is a byte array; 


p. A call to @addEntry@ returns the status of the operation (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKDefs@ for a list); 

 _Asynchronous call:_ 

 @public void asyncAddEntry(byte[] data, AddCallback cb, Object ctx) @ 

p. It also takes a byte array as the sequence of bytes to be stored as an entry. Additionaly, it takes a callback object @cb@ and a control object @ctx@ . The callback object must implement the @AddCallback@ interface in @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback@ , and a class implementing it has to implement a method called @addComplete@ that has the following signature: 

 @void addComplete(int rc, LedgerHandle lh, long entryId, Object ctx); @ 

p. where: 

*  @rc@ is a return code (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKDefs@ for a list); 
*  @lh@ is a @LedgerHandle@ object to manipulate a ledger; 
*  @entryId@ is the identifier of entry associated with this request; 
*  @ctx@ is control object used for accountability purposes. It can be any object the application is happy with. 


h1.  Closing a ledger. 

p. Once a client is done writing, it closes the ledger. The following methods belong to @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerHandle@ . 

 _Synchronous close:_ 

 @public void close() throws InterruptedException @ 

p. It takes no input parameters. 

 _Asynchronous close:_ 

 @public void asyncClose(CloseCallback cb, Object ctx) throws InterruptedException @ 

p. It takes a callback object @cb@ and a control object @ctx@ . The callback object must implement the @CloseCallback@ interface in @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback@ , and a class implementing it has to implement a method called @closeComplete@ that has the following signature: 

 @void closeComplete(int rc, LedgerHandle lh, Object ctx) @ 

p. where: 

*  @rc@ is a return code (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKDefs@ for a list); 
*  @lh@ is a @LedgerHandle@ object to manipulate a ledger; 
*  @ctx@ is control object used for accountability purposes. 


h1.  Opening a ledger. 

p. To read from a ledger, a client must open it first. The following methods belong to @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookKeeper@ . 

 _Synchronous open:_ 

 @public LedgerHandle openLedger(long lId, DigestType type, byte passwd[]) throws InterruptedException, BKException @ 

*  @lId@ is the ledger identifier; 
*  @type@ is the type of digest used with entries: either MAC or CRC32. 
*  @passwd@ is a password to access the ledger (used only in the case of @VERIFIABLE@ ledgers); 


 _Asynchronous open:_ 

 @public void asyncOpenLedger(long lId, DigestType type, byte passwd[], OpenCallback cb, Object ctx) @ 

p. It also takes a a ledger identifier and a password. Additionaly, it takes a callback object  @cb@ and a control object @ctx@ . The callback object must implement the @OpenCallback@ interface in @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback@ , and a class implementing it has to implement a method called @openComplete@ that has the following signature: 

 @public void openComplete(int rc, LedgerHandle lh, Object ctx) @ 

p. where: 

*  @rc@ is a return code (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKDefs@ for a list); 
*  @lh@ is a @LedgerHandle@ object to manipulate a ledger; 
*  @ctx@ is control object used for accountability purposes. 

p. The two calls above to open a ledger recover the ledger if it has not been closed properly before it reads entries from it. It is also possible to open a ledger and read from it without triggering the recovery process with the following methods of @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookKeeper@ . 

 _Synchronous open:_ 

 @public LedgerHandle openLedgerNoRecovery(long lId, DigestType type, byte passwd[]) throws InterruptedException, BKException @ 

*  @lId@ is the ledger identifier; 
*  @type@ is the type of digest used with entries: either MAC or CRC32. 
*  @passwd@ is a password to access the ledger (used only in the case of @VERIFIABLE@ ledgers); 


 _Asynchronous open:_ 

 @public void asyncOpenLedgerNoRecovery(long lId, DigestType type, byte passwd[], OpenCallback cb, Object ctx) @ 

p. It also takes a a ledger identifier and a password. Additionaly, it takes a callback object  @cb@ and a control object @ctx@ . The callback object must implement the @OpenCallback@ interface in @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback@ , and a class implementing it has to implement a method called @openComplete@ that has the following signature: 

 @public void openComplete(int rc, LedgerHandle lh, Object ctx) @ 

p. where: 

*  @rc@ is a return code (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKDefs@ for a list); 
*  @lh@ is a @LedgerHandle@ object to manipulate a ledger; 
*  @ctx@ is control object used for accountability purposes. 

h1.  Reading from ledger 

p. Read calls may request one or more consecutive entries. The following methods belong to @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerHandle@ . 

 _Synchronous read:_ 

 @public Enumeration<LedgerEntry> readEntries(long firstEntry, long lastEntry) throws InterruptedException, BKException @ 

*  @firstEntry@ is the identifier of the first entry in the sequence of entries to read; 
*  @lastEntry@ is the identifier of the last entry in the sequence of entries to read. 


 _Asynchronous read:_ 

 @public void asyncReadEntries(long firstEntry, long lastEntry, ReadCallback cb, Object ctx) throws BKException, InterruptedException @ 

p. It also takes a first and a last entry identifiers. Additionaly, it takes a callback object  @cb@ and a control object @ctx@ . The callback object must implement the @ReadCallback@ interface in @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback@ , and a class implementing it has to implement a method called @readComplete@ that has the following signature: 

 @void readComplete(int rc, LedgerHandle lh, Enumeration<LedgerEntry> seq, Object ctx) @ 

p. where: 

*  @rc@ is a return code (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKDefs@ for a list); 
*  @lh@ is a @LedgerHandle@ object to manipulate a ledger; 
*  @seq@ is a @Enumeration<LedgerEntry>@ object to containing the list of entries requested; 
*  @ctx@ is control object used for accountability purposes. 


h1.  Deleting a ledger 

p. Once a client is done with a ledger and is sure that nobody will ever need to read from it again, they can delete the ledger. The following methods belong to @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookKeeper@ . 

 _Synchronous delete:_ 

 @public void deleteLedger(long lId) throws InterruptedException, BKException @ 

*  @lId@ is the ledger identifier; 


 _Asynchronous delete:_ 

 @public void asyncDeleteLedger(long lId, DeleteCallback cb, Object ctx) @ 

p. It takes a ledger identifier. Additionally, it takes a callback object  @cb@ and a control object @ctx@ . The callback object must implement the @DeleteCallback@ interface in @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback@ , and a class implementing it has to implement a method called @deleteComplete@ that has the following signature: 

 @void deleteComplete(int rc, Object ctx) @ 

p. where: 

*  @rc@ is a return code (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKDefs@ for a list); 
*  @ctx@ is control object used for accountability purposes. 

h1.  Reading the last confirmed entry from a ledger 

p. When reading from an open ledger (opening without recovery enables it), it is often necessary to read the last confirmed hint that the writer client writes along with every entry. The general idea is to obtain the hint from a quorum and return the largest value. The following methods belong to @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookKeeper@ . 

 _Synchronous read:_ 

 @public long readLastConfirmed() @ 

 _Asynchronous read:_ 

 @public void asyncReadLastConfirmed(ReadLastConfirmedComplete cb, Object ctx) @ 
 
p. It takes a callback object  @cb@ and a control object @ctx@ . The callback object must implement the @ReadLastConfirmedCallback@ interface in @org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback@ , and a class implementing it has to implement a method called @readLastConfirmedComplete@ that has the following signature: 

@public void readLastConfirmedComplete (int rc, long lastConfirmed, Object ctx) @

p. where: 

*  @rc@ is a return code (please refer to @org.apache.bookeeper.client.BKDefs@ for a list); 
*  @lastConfirmed@ is the maximum last confirmed hint received among a quorum of bookies; 
*  @ctx@ is control object used for accountability purposes.
